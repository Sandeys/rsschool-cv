# Summary
I am one of the laziest students who started studying at rs-school. However, I am very purposeful and I really want to change a job that I do not like.
======
During my studies, my main goal is to acquire skills and knowledge that will be enough to find a new job. Course grades are not the main thing for me, as I often do not have time for the material because of the main work. I came to school with knowledge and I will get it!
